    Variables
    ---------

        B[0] is the bottom of the board
    x, y: position of current falling piece
    t: integer between [0, 7], current tetris piece number
    r: rotation of the current piece
    S: score, rows cleared
    e: keyup event object, or undefined if piece is just falling
    u: variable to save current piece position and rotation
    C: board updated with current piece
    a, b, f: temporary variables used to calculate rotations
    i, j: variables for iteration counters
    Z: <body> DOM object
    z: holds the intermediate value for rendered board
    T: Constant = 210
